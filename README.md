# Wege (Landlock)
Rules of the game:
------------------

Wege, or Landlock, is a game for two players. One player is "Land" and the other is "Water". The players take turns playing cards/tiles into a 6x6 grid to form a park. If you are "Land", your goal is to have a connected land path touch as many sides of the park as possible. If you are "Water", your goal is to create a connected stream of water that connects as many sides of the park as possible.

You can also win points by blocking your opponent. For "Land", you get bonus points for every pond you create (water that can't reach any side), and for "Water", you get bonus points for every island you create (a path that fails to reach any side). There are also gnomes that wander the path or swim in the water, and you get points for as many of these you can get to "face" each other on the board.

The game ends once a full 6x6 grid of tiles is played.

Each player takes turns, and on their turn they draw a new card/tile and decide where to play it. There are 4 kinds of cards: water cards that depict a stream of water. Land cards that depict a path of land. Cossack cards that depict neither paths nor streams, and bridge cards that depict crossing paths of land and streams of water. Some cards will have "gnomes" on them. A gnome can either be in the water or on the land, and the gnome is always at the corner of the card.

- To get a card, click on the large button at the bottom of the board.
- The first card played can go anywhere.
- Each additional card played must be placed adjacent to an existing card, either horizontally or vertically.
- The land and water on the card must match with the land/water of the card it is placed next to. Water cannot connect to land and land cannot connect to water.
  - Cards can be rotated 90Â° by clicking on the card while it is in the large button at the bottom of the board.

- There are special "bridge" cards. With a bridge card, you can either play it like a regular card, or you can use it to replace an existing water or land card. But:
  - A bridge card cannot replace a cossack card.
  - A bridge card cannot replace a land or water card if that card has a gnome AND that gnome is part of a group of "facing" gnomes.
  - If you replace a card with a bridge card, the other player must then use that replaced card on their turn instead of drawing a new card.

Please note that the game still has some bugs in it. Additionally, the game does not have automatic scoring, yet.
